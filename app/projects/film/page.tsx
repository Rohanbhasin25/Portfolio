              I grew obsessed with movies, from Shahrukh to Spielberg, I was obsessed with actions as small as a look,
              camera movements as subtle as David Fincher's and worlds that were as expansive as Ridley Scott's.

              Some of my inspirations are Kubrick, Nolan, Arronofsky, PTA, Villeneuve, Bong Joon-ho, Park Chan-wook, Zoya Akhtar, David Fincher, Shekhar Kapur, Cuaron, Abbas Kiarostami, Farah Khan (yes) and Jeffrey Sun.

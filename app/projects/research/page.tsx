                I've been involved with the Financial Services and Innovation Lab at Georgia Tech since 2023, working on
                projects such as tonal analysis for Earnings Call Transcripts, Feature extraction from investment memos
                and hawkish/dovish classifications for Central Bank Policies.

                To me good research is a pre-cursor to focusing on the right problems with the right approach. So, I
                conducted some independent research on topics I've been interested in such as bilingual Broca's Aphasia
